Please do same exercise using two different framework.

Framework 1. pandas
- Using pandas I was able to produce the required report
- code is commented to explains the steps
- output found in final_results.csv file

framework 2. apache beam python https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python/
I have tried using an apache beam pipeline but I was unable to produce the required report
It is a new software for me but I was able to do the following:
I am able to read the csv files and split them by ','
I am able to filter the sets and group by key to produce a key,value pair but I am not able to produce the correct key,value to do any further
transformations to the data. I have attached the current code that I have tried.

using two input files dataset1 and dataset2 

join dataset1 with dataset2 and get tier

generate below output file

legal_entity, counterparty, tier, max(rating by counterparty), sum(value where status=ARAP), sum(value where status=ACCR)

Also create new record to add total for each of legal entity, counterparty & tier.

Sample data:
legal_entity, 	counterparty, 	tier,  	max(rating by counterparty), 	sum(value where status=ARAP), 	sum(value where status=ACCR)
L1,           	Total,        	Total, 	calculated_value,            	calculated_value,             	calculated_value
L1, 		C1, 		Total,	calculated_value, 		calculated_value,		calculated_value
Total,		C1,		Total,	calculated_value, 		calculated_value,		calculated_value
Total,		Total,		1,	calculated_value, 		calculated_value,		calculated_value


L2,		Total,		Total,	calculated_value, 		calculated_value,		calculated_value
....
like all other values.

where caluclated_value in sample data needs to be calculated using above method.
