# HarTreeTest

Framework 1. pandas
- Using pandas I was able to produce the required report
- code is commented to explains the steps
- output found in final_results.csv file

framework 2. apache beam python https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python/
I have tried using an apache beam pipeline but I was unable to produce the required report
It is a new software for me but I was able to do the following:
I am able to read the csv files and split them by ','
I am able to filter the sets and group by key to produce a key,value pair but I am not able to produce the correct key,value to do any further
transformations to the data. I have attached the current code that I have tried.
